Everything I have made is in the map MyStuff.

Pre-made Build in the ABuild map above assets map.

I made this in ecs mostly looking at school lectures and doing the same as tough.
But also youtube.
I made entitys, components and systems in standard ecs ways and that should be performant.
Not much more to say because it was not a big game and most stuff where pretty straight 
forward to do as in the lectures and on youtube, but that don´t mean it wasn´t hard because 
it was.
